### Hi there, I'm Marcus ðŸ‘‹

### Who dat? ðŸ¤”
I'm a software engineer with a background in design and advertising. Also founder of [Modest Industries](https://modestindustries.co). You can see more of my stuff on [marcusmichaels.com](https://marcusmichaels.com)

### Do u social? ðŸ‘¯
Sure do! I take (lots of) photos of my desk and talk about projects and programming on Instagram: [@marcusmichaels](https://instagram.com/marcusmichaels)

I'm also on (but rarely post on) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcusmichaels), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@marcusmichaels)

### Can you recommend a good newsletter? ðŸ“« 
Funny you should ask! I built an automated tech/product/startup newsletter that collates links from my favourite sources and emails them to me three times a week. I call it [MarcusMail](https://bit.ly/marcus-mail), and you can sign up too if you'd like :)

### Working on any cool side-projects? ðŸš€
Who isn't?! When I have time I like to work on [Browser Snippets](https://browsersnippets.com), but a couple of my other projects are [Dead Wallet](https://deadwallet.com) and [Plottd](https://plottd.com)
