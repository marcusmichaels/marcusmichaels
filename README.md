### Hi there, I'm Marcus ðŸ‘‹

### Who dat? ðŸ¤”
I'm a software engineer at a Design Systems startup called (zeroheight)[https://zeroheight.com/], and founder of (Modest Industries)[https://modestindustries.co]. You can see more of my stuff on (marcusmichaels.com)[marcusmichaels.com]

### Do u social? ðŸ‘¯
Sure do! I take (lots of) photos of my desk and talk about projects and programming on Instagram: (@marcusmichaels)[https://instagram.com/marcusmichaels]

I'm also on (but rarely post on) (Titter)[https://twitter.com/marcusmichaels], and (Medium)[https://medium.com/@marcusmichaels]

### Can you recommend a good newsletter? ðŸ“« 
Funny you should ask! I built an automated tech/product/startup newsletter that collates links from my favourite sources and emails them to me three times a week. I call it (MarcusMail)[https://bit.ly/marcus-mail], and you can sign up too if you'd like :)

### Working on any cool side-projects? ðŸš€
Who isn't?! I've always got at least one thing on the go (when I have time to focus on it), but a couple that are live are (Dead Wallet)[https://deadwallet.com] and (Plottd)[https://plottd.com]
